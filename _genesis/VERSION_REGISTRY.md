# VERSION REGISTRY

> Current iteration: **I1** (all file versions must be 1.x)
> ALPEI sequence: A=1 ALIGN, L=2 LEARN, P=3 PLAN, E=4 EXECUTE, I=5 IMPROVE.
> Folder names (3-PLAN, 4-EXECUTE, 5-IMPROVE) reflect pre-ALPEI numbering — renaming deferred to I2.
> **Map Cell** column uses `P1-{A-E}{1-4}` grid notation. Values show `TBD` until Consumer 1 (A1 process map) ships.

> **Status key:** Not Started | Pending | Draft | Review | In Progress | Approved
> **Not Started** = this cell's primary artifact does not exist yet. **Pending** = upstream workstream not yet Approved — cannot start.
> **Map Cell** = TBD until Consumer 1 (A1 process map `_genesis/frameworks/alpei-dsbv-process-map.md`) is built.

## Sub-System Version Progression

4 sub-systems × 5 UES iteration levels. PD (Problem Diagnosis) governs all downstream sub-systems.
Version labels from `_genesis/frameworks/UES_VERSION_BEHAVIORS.md`.

| Sub-System                          | Logic Scaffold (PD) | Concept (DP)  | Prototype (DA) | MVE (IDM)  | Leadership     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| PD — Problem Diagnosis              | In Progress         | Pending        | Pending        | Pending    | Pending        |
| DP — Diagnosis Pipeline             | Pending             | Pending        | Pending        | Pending    | Pending        |
| DA — Diagnosis Analysis             | Pending             | Pending        | Pending        | Pending    | Pending        |
| IDM — Insight-Driven Management     | Pending             | Pending        | Pending        | Pending    | Pending        |

> PD is at Logic Scaffold (I1). DP, DA, IDM cannot exceed PD's version — downstream inherits upstream constraint.

## Notes

- **I1 constraint:** All file `version` fields must be `1.x`. Never `0.x` or `2.x` for I1 content.
- **2-LEARN** is an I1 Must deliverable. DSBV Build in progress — skill rerouting and cross-refs pending.
- **3-PLAN** UBS/UDS Registers are seeded from ALIGN but not yet in formal DSBV — status = Pending.
- **4-EXECUTE** DESIGN.md exists (multi-agent orchestration context) but DSBV Sequence not yet started.
- **5-IMPROVE** CHANGELOG.md initialized but DSBV has not formally started — status = Pending.
- **GOVERN workstream** does not use full DSBV for small patches — see `rules/alpei-chain-of-custody.md`.
- **Map Cell column** populates as `P1-{A-E}{1-4}` after Consumer 1 ships. Row ordering: A=ALIGN, B=LEARN, C=PLAN, D=EXECUTE, E=IMPROVE; columns 1-4 = Design, Sequence, Build, Validate.
- This file is updated manually at each milestone. Auto-derive rules for I2 are deferred to I2 planning.

## How Agents Update This File

This registry uses a **22-row workstream×phase matrix**: 20 cells (5 workstreams × 4 DSBV phases) plus 2 summary rows for GOVERN infrastructure and _genesis.

**Per-cell update rules:**
1. After editing any workstream artifact: find the matching `Workstream×Phase` row, update **Version + Status + AC Pass + Last Updated**.
2. After a DSBV phase transition (human approval): update the Status column for the completed phase row (Draft → Review) and the next phase row (Pending/Not Started → Draft).
3. After adding a key artifact to a Build cell: update the **Deliverable** column (comma-separated within the cell).
4. After Consumer 1 ships: replace all `TBD` values in **Map Cell** with `P1-{A-E}{1-4}` grid references.
5. Bump this file's own `version` (MINOR +1) and `last_updated` on every edit.
6. Mirror major state changes in `5-IMPROVE/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`.

**Column definitions:**
- `Workstream×Phase` — ALPEI workstream name × DSBV phase label (20 combinations)
- `Deliverable` — primary artifact name(s) for this cell
- `Version` — current version of the primary artifact (`—` if none exists)
- `Status` — one of exactly 6 values: `Not Started` | `Pending` | `Draft` | `Review` | `In Progress` | `Approved`
- `AC Pass` — fraction of ACs passing per VALIDATE.md (`—` if no validate yet)
- `Last Updated` — date of last meaningful change (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `Map Cell` — Consumer 1 process map grid reference (`TBD` until Consumer 1 ships)

**Status lifecycle:**
- Agent sets: `Draft`, `Review`, `In Progress`, `Not Started`, `Pending`
- Human ONLY sets: `Approved`
- Editing an `Approved` file → reset that row to `Draft`

## Version Bump Reference (I1)

```
New file in I1        → version: "1.0"
Committed at 1.Y      → next meaningful edit → "1.(Y+1)"
Wrong MAJOR (2.x)     → correct to 1.x (this is not a normal bump — it is a fix)
```
