# ALPEI-DSBV Process Map

## 1. Introduction

This document is the authoritative reference for how the LTC ALPEI framework and DSBV sub-process work together to produce workstream artifacts. It serves three consumers:


| Consumer                  | Use                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PM / Team member**      | Orientation: understand what workstream you are in, what stage is active, what gate you are approaching |
| **Agent (Sonnet / Opus)** | Context load: verify correct template, agent, and AC before producing any artifact                |
| **Training deck author**  | Slide content: each P-section maps to one or more training slides                                 |

## 2. P1 — 5×4 Matrix: ALPEI Workstreams × DSBV stages

Every workstream in the ALPEI system produces artifacts through the same four-stage DSBV sub-process: **Design → Sequence → Build → Validate**. The 5×4 matrix below makes that structure explicit — each cell names the template used, the deliverable path, the assigned agent, and the binary acceptance criterion for that workstream-stage intersection. 

**Problem Diagnosis (PD)** serves as the worked example sub-system with all 20 cells filled; all other sub-systems (DP, DA, IDM) follow the identical pattern, substituting their own deliverable paths and domain-specific content.

### Pre-DSBV stage — Research (ltc-explorer: Haiku)

> Before Design begins, **ltc-explorer** runs wide-net discovery. This is not a DSBV stage — it feeds the Design stage as input.


| Role             | Scope                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ltc-explorer** | Codebase exploration, existing template inventory, UBS/UDS signal gathering, source evaluation. Produces input notes only — no workstream artifacts. |


---

### Sub-System Inheritance Table

PD is the first sub-system and sets the version ceiling. DP, DA, and IDM follow the same 5×4 matrix pattern but may not exceed the version of their upstream sub-system.


| Sub-system | Full Name                | Inherits From           | Version Ceiling Rule                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **PD**     | Problem Diagnosis        | — (first in chain)      | Sets ceiling for all downstream sub-systems |
| **DP**     | Data Pipeline            | PD Effective Principles | DP version ≤ PD version                     |
| **DA**     | Data Analytics           | DP Effective Principles | DA version ≤ DP version                     |
| **IDM**    | Informed Decision Making | DA Effective Principles | IDM version ≤ DA version                    |


**Inheritance rule:** Each sub-system's Effective Principles (produced in LEARN workstream Build) are inherited by the next sub-system as validated inputs. A downstream sub-system may not advance to a higher version than its upstream dependency. If PD is at v1.2, DP may not exceed v1.2.

> PD is the worked example showing all 20 cells. DP, DA, and IDM follow the identical workstream × stage structure with their own deliverable paths and domain content.

## 3. P2 — Version Progression: What Each Workstream Produces at Each Depth

The ALPEI framework defines 5 version levels. Each level sets a ceiling on what any workstream is allowed to produce — building deeper than your current version is waste; building shallower is a gap. This section maps those version levels to LTC iteration naming (Iteration 0–Iteration 4) and shows exactly what "done" looks like at every workstream-version intersection.

Source of truth for all 25 cells: `_genesis/frameworks/ues-version-behaviors.md`.

### Version Naming Map


| LTC Name | Original UES Name               | Three Pillars Alignment                      | One-Line Summary                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Iteration 0**   | Logic Scaffold                  | Pre-build (no pillar yet)                    | Map scope and logic only — no implementation  |
| **Iteration 1**   | Concept                         | Sustainability only                          | Prove correctness and safety — nothing breaks |
| **Iteration 2**   | Prototype                       | Sustainability + Efficiency                  | Work on real data and outperform alternatives |
| **Iteration 3**   | MVE (Minimum Viable Experience) | Sustainability + Efficiency (fully realized) | Production-grade — reliable at current scale  |
| **Iteration 4**   | Leadership                      | Sustainability + Efficiency + Scalability    | Self-improving, self-executing, predictive    |


> **Reading rule:** Iteration 0 is pre-build framing. Iteration 1 adds the first pillar (Safety/Sustainability). Each subsequent level adds capability, not replaces it — Iteration 4 assumes everything from Iteration 0–Iteration 3 is complete and stable.

### Practical Calibration Guide

Use this to sanity-check deliverables before starting or reviewing work.

**Iteration 0 — Logic Scaffold (Pre-build)**
DO: Scope definitions, structural maps, dependency diagrams, VANA criteria (initial), stakeholder lists (draft), UBS/UDS inventories (identified, not yet analyzed), conceptual task lists.
DO NOT: Working code, automated pipelines, validated principles, signed-off plans, locked registers, any executed output.

**Iteration 1 — Concept (Sustainability)**
DO: Validated charters and safety-checked designs, simulated or manual-but-correct workflows, Risk Registers with populated entries, structured feedback collection.
DO NOT: Efficiency benchmarks, optimized systems, production-grade automation, real-data testing, locked or committed plans.

**Iteration 2 — Prototype (Sustainability + Efficiency)**
DO: Working tools using real data (limited scope), efficiency comparisons vs. Iteration 1 manual approach, benchmarked performance, populated Driver Registers, optimized critical paths.
DO NOT: Fully scaled systems, production-grade reliability, self-healing automation, comprehensive audit trails.

**Iteration 3 — MVE (Full S+E)**
DO: Production-grade deliverables reliable at current scale, locked plans, final RACI, committed sprint schedules, stakeholder sign-off, closed-loop improvement tracking.
DO NOT: Self-optimizing systems, predictive analytics, auto-scaling infrastructure, anything that adjusts itself without human trigger.

**Iteration 4 — Leadership (S+E+Scalability)**
DO: Self-executing workflows, auto-scaling operations, predictive models (issues, blockers, resource needs), self-adjusting OKRs, systems that learn and update Effective Principles autonomously.
DO NOT: New foundational work — Iteration 4 presumes Iteration 0–Iteration 3 are complete and stable. Manual workarounds — a manual step at Iteration 4 is a gap, not a feature.

### Sub-System Inheritance Note

When a project has multiple sub-systems (e.g., PD → DP → DA → IDM), the **Problem Diagnosis (PD) version sets the ceiling** for all downstream sub-systems.


| PD Version | DP ceiling                                        | DA ceiling                              | IDM ceiling                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Iteration 0         | Pipeline design is conceptual only                | Analysis methodology is mapped only     | Decision framework is theoretical only     |
| Iteration 1         | Pipeline must handle data safely and correctly    | Analysis must produce validated results | Decisions must be provably safe            |
| Iteration 2         | Pipeline must be more efficient than alternatives | Analysis must outperform prior methods  | Decisions must demonstrate better outcomes |
| Iteration 3         | Pipeline must be production-reliable              | Analysis must be production-reliable    | Decisions must be reliably actionable      |
| Iteration 4         | Pipeline self-optimizes and scales                | Analysis auto-detects patterns          | Decisions are predictive and prescriptive  |


**Rule:** If a downstream sub-system's design conflicts with PD's Effective Principles, PD wins. Downstream sub-systems cannot exceed their upstream dependency's version level.

## 4. P3 — ALIGN Workstream Walkthrough: How It Actually Works

When you run `/dsbv design align`, a structured sequence of agents, rules, and human gates activates — not a chat. Every artifact is produced under contract (DESIGN.md), every stage transition requires your approval, and five always-on rules enforce quality at every step. The walkthrough below traces exactly what happens, from the moment you type the command to the moment ALIGN is marked complete.

### Gate Summary


| Gate | Trigger condition                                        | Blocks what                                        |

Gates are decision points, not labels. The system does not advance automatically — it stops and waits.

### Always-On Rules (Every Stage)

Five rules load at session start and fire continuously. They cannot be disabled per-command.


| Rule                       | File                                      | What it enforces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **alpei-pre-flight**       | `scripts/pre-flight.sh`                   | 9 checks before every task: workstream, alignment, risks, drivers, templates, learning, version, S>E>Sc, decisions. RED = stop.                                                                                                                                     |
| **alpei-chain-of-custody** | `.claude/rules/alpei-chain-of-custody.md` | Workstream N cannot build until Workstream N-1 has ≥1 validated artifact. stage ordering: Design → Sequence → Build → Validate, no skips.                                                                                                                                 |
| **versioning**             | `.claude/rules/versioning.md`             | Every edited `.md` file must have `version`, `status`, `last_updated` frontmatter. Iteration 1 files = 1.x. Agent sets Draft/Review. Human ONLY sets Approved.                                                                                                         |
| **dsbv**                   | `.claude/skills/dsbv/SKILL.md`            | No artifact produced outside DSBV. stage ordering enforced with hard gates. Workstream N cannot reach Review until Workstream N-1 has ≥1 Approved artifact.                                                                                                               |
| **agent-dispatch**         | `.claude/rules/agent-dispatch.md`         | Every Agent() call must: (1) name one of the 4 MECE agents, (2) use 5-field context package (EO → INPUT → EP → OUTPUT → VERIFY), (3) match model to agent file, (4) use absolute paths in worktrees. Enforced via PreToolUse hook — ad-hoc calls are blocked. |

### Agent Roster


| Agent        | Model  | DSBV stage        | Scope boundary                                                     |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ltc-explorer | Haiku  | Pre-DSBV          | Read-only research and discovery. Does NOT produce workstream artifacts. |
| ltc-planner  | Opus   | Design + Sequence | Defines WHAT to build and in what order. Does NOT write artifacts. |
| ltc-builder  | Sonnet | Build             | Produces artifacts per SEQUENCE.md. Does NOT design or review.     |
| ltc-reviewer | Opus   | Validate          | Reviews against DESIGN.md criteria. Does NOT fix — reports only.   |

### Example: PM ↔ Agent Interaction

This is what the ALIGN Design → Sequence transition looks like in practice.

---

**PM:** `/dsbv design align`

**ltc-planner:** Pre-flight check — all 6 conditions GREEN. Loading dsbv-context-template.md. What do you want ALIGN to accomplish for the PD sub-system? Give me 1-3 sentences.

**PM:** ALIGN should define success for the PD sub-system: stakeholders, OKRs, and the decision log for why we chose this scope.

**ltc-planner:** Drafting DESIGN.md now.

> Artifact inventory: charter (PD scope + stakeholders), OKR register (3 OKRs, binary ACs), decision log (ADR-001 scope choice). Alignment table: 3 completion conditions, 3 artifacts, 0 orphans. Versioning: version 1.0 / status Draft / last_updated 2026-03-30.
>
> **G1 — Design complete.** I produced: `1-ALIGN/DESIGN.md` (3 artifacts, 0 orphan conditions). Ready to proceed to Sequence?

**PM:** Looks good. Proceed.

**ltc-planner:** G1 approved. Running `/dsbv sequence align`.

> Reading approved DESIGN.md. Task order: (1) Draft charter — 45 min, inputs: stakeholder list; (2) Draft OKR register — 30 min, inputs: charter §Objectives; (3) Draft ADR-001 — 20 min, inputs: charter §Scope. Total: ~95 min.
>
> **G2 — Sequence complete.** Task order above, sizes confirmed. Ready to proceed to Build?

**PM:** Approved. Launch Build.

**ltc-planner:** G2 approved. Dispatching ltc-builder with 5-field context package. Cost estimate: single-agent Build ~$3-5. Proceed? [y/n]

---

The PM makes three decisions in this exchange: approve Design, approve Sequence, authorize Build cost. The agents do not advance on their own.

## 5. P4 — LEARN Workstream: Cross-Workstream Data Flows

LEARN (LEARN workstream) is the research engine of the ALPEI system. It converts raw stakeholder input and framework analysis into structured artifacts — UBS threat inventories, UDS driver inventories, and Effective Principles — that every downstream workstream consumes. LEARN does not produce decisions or plans; it produces the evidence base that makes decisions and plans defensible. Two flows are upstream (LEARN feeds ALIGN and PLAN directly) and one is bidirectional (ALIGN charter scopes what LEARN researches; LEARN findings refine the charter).

### What Stays in LEARN vs. What Crosses Boundaries


| Category             | Stays in 2-LEARN/                                          | Crosses to Other Workstreams                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Raw input            | `input/raw/` — unprocessed transcripts, photos, recordings | No — raw data does not cross; only synthesized output does                                       |
| Research methodology | `1-PD/pd-research-spec.md`                             | Partial — methodology rationale cross-references into `3-PLAN/1-PD/pd-architecture.md`      |
| Structured analysis  | `1-PD/pd-ubs-uds.md`                                     | Yes — full inventory crosses to `3-PLAN/risks/` and `3-PLAN/drivers/`                            |
| Effective Principles | `1-PD/pd-effective-principles.md`                        | Yes — crosses to `1-ALIGN/1-PD/pd-charter.md` and `3-PLAN/1-PD/pd-architecture.md`          |
| Research evidence    | `1-PD/pd-research-spec.md`                            | Yes — crosses to `1-ALIGN/decisions/ADR_*.md` as decision rationale                              |
| VANA specifications  | `specs/`                                                   | No — VANA specs are internal to LEARN; they define what research must validate                   |
| Archive / superseded | `archive/`                                                 | No — completed research stays archived in LEARN; downstream workstreams retain only what they consumed |


**Boundary rule:** Only artifacts in `2-LEARN/output/` and `2-LEARN/research/` cross workstream boundaries. Raw input and internal specs are consumed within LEARN and do not propagate.

### LEARN ↔ ALIGN Bidirectional Relationship

LEARN and ALIGN have a two-way dependency that is intentional and bounded:

```
  1-ALIGN/1-PD/pd-charter.md
         │
         │  (1) Charter defines the research scope:

**Constraint:** ALIGN sets the initial scope boundary. LEARN cannot expand scope unilaterally — scope changes discovered during LEARN must be surfaced as ADR entries in `1-ALIGN/decisions/` and approved by the human before the charter is updated. LEARN refines; it does not redefine.

### LEARN → PLAN → EXECUTE Chain

LEARN outputs do not skip workstreams. The propagation path is strictly sequential:

```
2-LEARN/1-PD/pd-ubs-uds.md
    └──► 3-PLAN/risks/UBS_REGISTER.md       (mitigations defined)
              └──► 4-EXECUTE/                (mitigations implemented as checkpoints and validation gates)

2-LEARN/1-PD/pd-effective-principles.md
    └──► 3-PLAN/1-PD/pd-architecture.md     (constraints codified)
              └──► 4-EXECUTE/src/            (implementation must comply with architecture constraints)
```

EXECUTE workstream inherits from PLAN workstream, which inherits from LEARN workstream. EXECUTE does not read LEARN artifacts directly — it reads PLAN artifacts that were populated from LEARN. This one-hop indirection keeps EXECUTE focused on building, not researching.

### LEARN Pipeline — The 6-Skill Mechanism

LEARN is pre-DSBV research infrastructure. It does not use DSBV stages (Design → Sequence → Build → Validate) internally — instead, it uses a dedicated `/learn` pipeline that is state-aware, file-system-driven, and skill-dispatched. The entry point is `/learn {slug}`, which derives the current state from what files already exist in `2-LEARN/` and invokes the appropriate sub-skill. When the pipeline reaches State 5 (complete), the correct next step is `/dsbv design` for the downstream workstream — LEARN hands off to DSBV, it does not replace it. Templates for all P-page types are project-local: `2-LEARN/templates/page-{n}-*.md`.

#### State Machine


| State | Trigger condition                                         | Skill invoked                                                         | Output produced                                                        |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S1    | No input file exists for slug                             | `/learn:input`                                                        | `2-LEARN/input/learn-input-{slug}.md`                                  |
| S2    | Input exists; no research dir for slug                    | `/learn:research {slug}`                                              | `2-LEARN/research/{slug}/` — raw research files per topic              |
| S3    | Research dir exists; ≥1 topic missing validated P-pages    | `/learn:structure {slug} {topic}` then `/learn:review {slug} {topic}` | `2-LEARN/research/{slug}/{topic}/P0–P7.md` all with `status: validated` |
| S4    | All topics validated; no vana-spec exists                  | `/learn:spec {slug}`                                                  | `2-LEARN/specs/{slug}/vana-spec.md` + `DSBV-READY-{slug}.md`           |
| S5    | Pipeline complete (vana-spec exists, all topics validated) | *(no skill — pipeline done)*                                          | Run `/dsbv design` for the target downstream workstream                      |


#### P0–P7 Page Structure (per topic)


| Page | Type                          | Content                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| P0   | Overview & Summary            | Problem definition, scope boundaries, key concepts       |
| P1   | Ultimate Blockers             | UBS entries — threats, root causes, failure modes        |
| P2   | Ultimate Drivers              | UDS entries — enablers, leverage points, success factors |
| P3   | Effective Principles          | Governing rules derived from P0–P2 analysis              |
| P4   | Components                    | System elements, structural breakdown, taxonomy          |
| P5   | Steps to Apply                | Operational procedure — how to use the knowledge         |
| P7   | Topic Distilled Understanding | Synthesis: what this topic means for the project         |


#### Workstream-Crossing Outputs


| Output file                                    | Consumed by                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `2-LEARN/{N}-{SUB}/{sub}-ubs-uds.md`              | `3-PLAN/risks/UBS_REGISTER.md` (UBS entries) · `3-PLAN/drivers/UDS_REGISTER.md` (UDS entries)                     |
| `2-LEARN/{N}-{SUB}/{sub}-effective-principles.md` | `1-ALIGN/{N}-{SUB}/{sub}-charter.md` (§Design Principles) · `3-PLAN/{N}-{SUB}/{sub}-architecture.md` (component constraints) |
| `2-LEARN/specs/{slug}/vana-spec.md`            | Downstream DSBV Design stages — initializes Design context for the consuming workstream                                 |


LEARN completes (S5) → run `/dsbv design` for the target downstream workstream.

## 7. Routing Tables — Agent Dispatch by Workstream × Stage

> **Purpose:** Runtime lookup for agent dispatch and template selection. To find the correct template and agent for any task, grep `## Routing: {WORKSTREAM}` in this file, then read the row matching your current DSBV stage.
>
> **Lookup syntax:** `grep "## Routing: PLAN" _genesis/frameworks/alpei-dsbv-process-map.md`
>
> **Update rule (DD-3):** When a new template is added, add a row to its Routing section and update `_genesis/templates/README.md`. No changes to rules or skill files — they reference this map by anchor.
