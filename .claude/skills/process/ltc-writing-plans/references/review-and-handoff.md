# Plan Review Loop & Execution Handoff

Reference extracted from SKILL.md. Loaded on demand after plan validation passes.

## Plan Review Loop

After writing the complete plan and passing the validation checklist:

1. Dispatch a single plan-document-reviewer subagent (see plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md) with precisely crafted review context — never your session history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the plan, not your thought process.
   - Provide: path to the plan document, path to spec document
2. If Issues Found: fix the issues, re-dispatch reviewer for the whole plan
3. If Approved: proceed to execution handoff

**Review loop guidance:**
- Same agent that wrote the plan fixes it (preserves context)
- If loop exceeds 3 iterations, surface to human for guidance
- Reviewers are advisory — explain disagreements if you believe feedback is incorrect

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `3-PLAN/architecture/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Inline Execution** — Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development
- Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review

**If Inline Execution chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:executing-plans
- Batch execution with checkpoints for review
